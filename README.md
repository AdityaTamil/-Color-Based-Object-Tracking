Real-Time Color Object Detection and Tracking

This project detects and tracks an object of a specific color in real time using a webcam feed. The system converts video frames to the HSV color space, making color detection more robust to lighting variations. The detected object is highlighted with a bounding box in the live video stream.


Features

Real-time webcam input processing

HSV-based color detection

Bounding box visualization around the detected object


Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV


How It Works

Captures live video from the webcam

Converts frames from BGR to HSV color space

Detects regions matching the specified color range

Tracks and highlights the object using a bounding box


Output

Live video feed

Clear bounding box around the detected colored object


Applications

Object tracking

Computer vision learning projects
