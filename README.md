Real-Time Color Object Detection and Tracking

This project detects and tracks an object of a specific color in real time using a webcam feed. The system converts video frames to the HSV color space, making color detection more robust to lighting variations. The detected object is highlighted with a bounding box in the live video stream.

✨ Features

Real-time webcam input processing

HSV-based color detection

Smooth object tracking with minimal lag

Bounding box visualization around the detected object

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV

📷 How It Works

Captures live video from the webcam

Converts frames from BGR to HSV color space

Detects regions matching the specified color range

Tracks and highlights the object using a bounding box


📌 Output

Live video feed

Clear bounding box around the detected colored object

🚀 Applications

Object tracking
